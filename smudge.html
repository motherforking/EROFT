		<h3>a guide to cleansing your devices</h3>
		<hr>
		
		<h2>step 1 - gather and free your devices</h2>
		<p>make sure you know what devices you want to cleanse, and make sure they're charged. when you have them all within reach, take them out of their cases, if applicable. take your phone and tablet out of their case. let them breathe. unplug them, if they have enough battery. suppress notifications, whether that's by turning on do not disturb or otherwise. set them all out on a flat surface, and make sure there's space in between all of them. once each device sits independently, pick one to start with</p>
		
		<h2>step 2 - organize and assess files</h2>
		<p class="box"><b>mobile devices: </b>phones and other mobile devices are a little more interesting than desktop/laptop computers. Most phones do have file systems, but they're a bit more elusive than on a computer. it wasn't until ios 11 in 2017 that apple put a file manager app on iphone and ipad. for this step, you can use the mobile file manager app, but know that some are lacking in features. for devices without file manager apps (or devices with inadequate apps), you can plug your device into a desktop/laptop computer and use the computer's file manager.</p>
		<p>open your file management app (file explorer on windows, finder on mac) and navigate to your 'Downloads' folder. this is one of the folders with the most buildup of unneccessary files. delete any old installers. delete any duplicate files. delete any zip files that have already been unzipped. delete any files that you are not going to use again soon, or any files that can be easily re-downloaded. now, move the remaining files to their appropriate folders. every computer has built-in folders to help organize. and although in 2023 'Documents' and 'Pictures' and 'Videos' are likely synced to onedrive or icloud, they are still very useful. if you don't use the cloud sync features, go into your settings and turn it off.</p>
		<p>now, navigate to your 'Desktop' folder and again delete anything unneccessary. and again, move any remaining files into their appropriate folders. 'Desktop' is a unique folder because each person may use it a little differently. some people like a perfectly clean desktop. i am one of these people. however, if you like shortcuts on your desktop, or frequently-used files or sub-folders, feel free to keep them.</p>
		<p>finally, go through those other folders, and make sure only what belongs remains. move all videos from 'Music' to 'Videos'. put your documents in 'Documents'. if you need to make new folders to hold files, that's great! but try not to be a file hoarder. disk space isn't limitless, so make sure you're not holding onto files that take up too much space. if a file (or especially folder) is a little big for your liking, compress it. windows and macos have built in file compression features. there are also great 3rd party apps like <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> or <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/">win-rar</a>. Once you've cut the files that you don't need, and the remaining files are where they should be, you're ready for step 3.</p>
		
		<h2>step 3 - remove old/unneccessary apps</h2>
		<p>alright, this step is very simple. first, look at all of the apps you have installed on your device. on mobile devices, this is easier. on windows computers you can go to 'programs and features' in control panel. on mac, go to your 'Applications' folder. go through the apps, and ask yourself if you really need the app. think about the last time you used it, or the next time you plan to. if you can't see yourself using it anytime soon, trash it. one thing to keep in mind is pesky programs that hide from plain view. for example, certain game launchers don't put installed games in as public of view. if you have any game launchers, go through them to see what games you may have forgotten are installed. </p>
		
		<h2>step 4 - power down your devices</h2>
		<p>possibly the easiest step yet. just restart your devices. on newer apple devices without home buttons, hold the power button and either volume button at the same time until the power off screen comes up. on most other devices, just holding the power button will bring up the power off screen. on the screen, if there's a 'restart' option, disregard it. choose 'shut off' or 'power off' or whatever is clearly the option to completely power off your device. once all devices are completely powered off, continue to step 5.</p>
		
		<h2>step 5 - clean your devices</h2>
		<p>this step is the most physical. if you have a microfiber cloth, that's great. if not, any soft cloth will do. simply wipe down your device with the cloth. if there's any buildup anywhere, it may be neccessary to slightly wet the cloth. DO NOT GET THE CLOTH TOO WET! we all know water is bad for electronics, so make sure the cloth is damp at most. also, it might be a good idea to wash your hands before this step, to make sure the devices don't get dirty while you're cleaning them. once the devices are cleaned (and dry), continue to step 6.</p>
		
		<h2>step 6 - admire and reset your devices</h2>
		<p>step 6 comes after step 5, but you don't have to do it immediately. in fact, i reccommend waiting as long as possible between steps 5 and 6. it gives the devices more time to chill, and it gives you, the user, some quality offline time. during the waiting period, i reccommend admiring your devices. note the size and shape. the color and the material. how the textures feel as you drag a finger across them. most people's devices live in their cases, and it's nice every once and a while to remember that these are tangible objects with a lot of thoughtful design behind them. once you're done appreciating your devices, you can return them to their cases, and turn them back on. don't get right on your device after powering it on, though. give it some time to get up and running again.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>conclusion</h2>
		<p>you made it! now wasn't that nice? hopefully in cleansing your devices you've gained a better appreciation for them. e-smudging is a great way to take a second and engage with your electronics in a different way. we're so used to our devices being there just for us to use. our devices are instruments we use for scrolling and texting and streaming, but they're so much more than the apps you can get on it.</p>
