		<h2>meditation 3 for EROFT, fall 23</h2>
		<hr><br>
		<p>to find inspiration for this project, i closed my eyes and scrolled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_divination">Wikipedia's list of divination techniques</a>. (thanks professor for the resource)</p>
		<p>the "omancy" that i landed on was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichnomancy">ichnomancy</a>, which is divination based on footprints.</p>
		<p>immediately, i thought of the idea of a digital footprint, something that i was already (sorta) thinking about for this project.</p>
		<img src="footprint.gif" alt="an illustration of a footprint behind ones and zeros (digital footprint)">
		<p>i couldn't find many details about how traditional ichnomancy works, so i'm making it up now.</p>
		<img src="social-footprint.png" alt="an illustration of a footprint with social media icons replacing the toes">
		<p>big toe - core - twitter; 2nd toe - appearance - instagram; 3rd toe - digital age - facebook; 4th toe - attitude - youtube;pinky - balance - spotify</p>
		<h3>future plans</h3>
