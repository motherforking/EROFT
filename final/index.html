		<h2>final meditation for EROFT, fall 23</h2>
		<hr><br>
        <p>for my final meditation, i chose to exapnd on my previous meditation, <a href=tarot-reader/tarot.html>tarot reader</a>. i wanted to turn it into more of an experience, and i did this by turning it into a guide through a tarot reading.</p>
        <p>i also wanted to add some sort of character that would "talk to" the user. i drew some rough sketches with different symbols and icons that the character would appear as throughout the reading.</p>

        <p>implemented in the tarot reader now are the smiley face, as well as the eye and the three card icons. the smiley face and eye were to give the app somewhat of a human feel, so it's like your cards are actually being <i>read</i> by someone. the three cards icon is to show how users should lay out the cards.</p>
        <p>access the tarot reader <a href="tarot-reader.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>future plans</h3>
        <hr><br>
        <p>i very much want to come back and polish up how the reader works. currently, to move ahead, users have to show the back of a card to the camera. this works best with a card from the deck, but that distinction is hard to get across. a clickable button might be better, even if it does make the user actually use the computer. or maybe voice control to move ahead, hololens style.</p>
        <p>also, the reader only recognizes three specific cards from my deck, as well as the back design. i'd like to have it recognize every card, and the designs of the rider-waite-smith deck, since that's the most common. i currently use <a href="https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/">mindAR</a> to recognize the images, which might not be the best choice for this project. i want to find another library that's better for a large number of images.</p>
        <p>finally, i also want to polish up the visual design. i like the minimalistic style, but i'd like the icons like the smiley face to be more animated. while the eye icon does "blink," i'd still like it to move a little more, to make it seem more alive. also the camera preview is in an awkward position, and i'd like to stylize it more, maybe applying a color filter or something like that.</p>
