		<h2>meditation 2 for EROFT, fall 23</h2>
		<hr><br>
		<p>tarot reading is one of the most popular ritual practices today, somewhat because of the accessibility.</p>
		<img src="10s.jpg" alt="the ten of swords card, from the rider-waite-smith tarot">
		<p>to make tarot even more accessible, especially for people on their own, i came up with this electronic tarot reader</p>
		<img src="" alt="screenshot from the tarot reader">
		<p>for people who want to learn how to read tarot, there's plenty of resources online, but fledgeling tarot readers have to either memorize the interpretations of different cards, or look them up as they're doing a reading</p>
		<p>during the exercise in class, i wished that there was a way to just see the meaning of a card just by looking at it. this is of course one way of interpreting cards; you can just look at the art on the card and discern a meaning from there</p>
		<p>my electronic tarot reader makes early (and solo) tarot readings easier</p> 
		<p><a href="tarot-reader.html">tarot reader</a></p>
		<p>to create the tarot reader, i used mindar, to recognize the tarot cards when held up to the webcam.</p>
		<p>in terms of format, it's obviously just a web page. very simple html and css. if i were to continue working on the project, i would probably make it more visually interesting. the old internet sort of style is fun, and i personally really love it and want to do a lot of work with it, but i feel like with this project there's more i could include, like images or interactivity</p>
		<p>the format is also a source of conflict. the manual encourages people to disengage from their devices, or at least engage in a different way. that's difficult though, when the manual is a webpage. it could be printed out, but that would completely rule out interactivity.</p>
